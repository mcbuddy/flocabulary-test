## How to run test

### Task 1
I use bahave for easier test case and python coding with good reporting result. This my second time using behave testing framework.
The structure pretty standard behave project without proper page-object, we can refactor and add more functionality on the page class.
but overall we can still reuse the step as I show in this project.

To run all the test suites just type `behave` in the shell command-line/terminal

To run one particular the test,  type `behave features/<file_name_>.feature ` in the shell command-line/terminal
